        <h3>Here are some quotes from the book:</h3>
        <br>
        <p>“ Stop comparing your progress to anyone else. Why would you take time comparing your fingerprint to someone else’s? You cannot compare your purpose to your neighbors. So, acknowledge and believe your purpose is Unique to YOU. I think at one point in all of our lives we had some degree of belief in our ability to accomplish something. WHAT HAPPENED?” </p>
        <br>
        <p>“Believe it or not God made YOU with all YOU need to fulfill UR purpose”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“U are on a mission to fulfill UR purpose. You have to get to the real U!! You have to persevere. Perseverance is just another word for STANDING, in motion. No matter what, hold on to UR purpose and keep moving!!”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Take a moment to think. “Am I convinced I am able to accomplish my passion?” Yes, be convinced! Please know that nothing is impossible. U can do it and no one can do it better! U cannot be duplicated. I understand that the idea is foreign to some of us. But U were made for this. Don’t let life’s weeds overtake you.
        U are incredible!! There is absolutely nothing out of your reach.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>That is what BU is all about!</p>
